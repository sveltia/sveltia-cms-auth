# Sveltia CMS Authenticator

This simple [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) script allows [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) (or Netlify/Decap CMS) users to authenticate with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#authorization-code-flow).

You don’t have to use it if you previously had Netlify/Decap CMS and your site is still being deployed to Netlify or if you have already used [another 3rd party OAuth client](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/).

You can use it if your site is hosted (or has been moved to) somewhere else, such as [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and you don’t have any other 3rd party client yet.

## How to use it

### Step 1. Deploy this project to Cloudflare Workers

Sign up with Cloudflare, and click the button below to start deploying.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth)

Alternatively, you can clone the project and run [`wrangler deploy`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) locally.

Once deployed, open your Cloudflare Workers dashboard, select the `sveltia-cms-auth` service, then the worker URL (`https://sveltia-cms-auth.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`) will be displayed. Copy it for Step 2. It will also be used in Step 4.

### Step 2. Register the Worker as an OAuth app

#### GitHub

[Register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) on GitHub ([details](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)) with the following properties, including your Worker URL from Step 1:

- Application name: `Sveltia CMS Authenticator` (or whatever)
- Homepage URL: `https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth` (or whatever)
- Application description: (can be left empty)
- Authorization callback URL: `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/callback`

Once registered, click on the **Generate a new client secret** button. The app’s **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed. We’ll use them in Step 3 below.

#### GitLab

[Register a new OAuth application](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) on GitLab ([details](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#create-a-user-owned-application)) with the following properties, including your Worker URL from Step 1:

- Name: `Sveltia CMS Authenticator` (or whatever)
- Redirect URI: `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/callback`
- Confidential: Yes
- Scopes: `api` only

Once registered, the app’s **Application ID** and **Secret** will be displayed. We’ll use them in Step 3 below.

### Step 3. Configure the Worker

Go back to the `sveltia-cms-auth` service page on the Cloudflare dashboard, select **Settings** > **Variables**, and add the following Environment Variables to your worker ([details](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/environment-variables/#environment-variables-via-the-dashboard)):

#### GitHub

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: **Client ID** from Step 2
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: **Client Secret** from Step 2; click the **Encrypt** button to hide it
- `GITHUB_HOSTNAME`: Required only if you’re using GitHub Enterprise Server. Default: `github.com`

#### GitLab

- `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`: **Application ID** from Step 2
- `GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`: **Secret** from Step 2; click the **Encrypt** button to hide it
- `GITLAB_HOSTNAME`: Required only if you’re using a self-hosted instance. Default: `gitlab.com`

#### Both GitHub and GitLab

- `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`: (Optional) Your site’s hostname, e.g. `www.example.com`
  - Multiple hostnames can be defined as a comma-separated list, e.g. `www.example.com, www.example.org`
  - A wildcard (`*`) can be used to match any subdomain, e.g. `*.example.com` that will match `www.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, `docs.api.example.com`, etc. (but not `example.com`)
  - To match a `www`-less naked domain and all the subdomains, use `example.com, *.example.com`

Save and deploy.

### Step 4. Update your CMS configuration

Open `admin/config.yml` locally or remotely, and add your Worker URL from Step 1 as the new `base_url` property under `backend`:

```diff
 backend:
   name: github # or gitlab
   repo: username/repo
   branch: main
+  base_url: <YOUR_WORKER_URL>
```

Commit the change. Once deployed, you can sign into Sveltia CMS remotely with GitHub or GitLab!

## FAQ

### Why do I have to set this thing up in the first place?

Technically, we could host Sveltia CMS Authenticator on our own server and let anyone use it, just like Netlify does. The cost probably wouldn’t matter because it’s just a small, short-lived script. However, running such a **service** certainly comes with legal, privacy and security liabilities that we cannot afford. Remember that Sveltia CMS is nothing more than [@kyoshino](https://github.com/kyoshino)’s personal project. That’s why the authenticator is not offered as SaaS and you have to install it yourself.
